# üå∏ Iris Flower Species Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species based on their physical features. The project is built and run on Google Colab and demonstrates the full data science pipeline‚Äîfrom data loading and exploratory analysis to model training and evaluation.

## üìå Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic multivariate dataset introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify each flower into one of three species:
- *Iris-setosa*
- *Iris-versicolor*
- *Iris-virginica*

This project:
- Loads and preprocesses the dataset
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizes data distributions and relationships
- Applies several classification algorithms
- Compares model performance
- Evaluates the best-performing model using accuracy and confusion matrices

## üîç Key Features

- **Clean and modular code** implemented in a Google Colab notebook
- **EDA with visualizations** using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas`
- **Multiple ML algorithms**: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines
- **Model evaluation** using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score
- **Well-structured and annotated notebook** for clarity and learning purposes
